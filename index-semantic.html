        <p class="p3">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his 
            neighbours came around to commiserate. They said, <br><span id="farmers">[</span><q class="farmers">We are so sorry to hear 
            your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><span id="farmers">]</span> The farmer said, <span id="father">[</span>
            <em>"Maybe."</em><span id="father">]</span><br>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening 
            everybody came back and said, <span id="farmers">[</span><q class="farmers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of 
            events. You now have eight horses!</q><span id="farmers">]</span> The farmer again said, <span id="father">[</span>
            <em>"Maybe."</em><span id="father">]</span>
        </p>

        <p class ="p4">
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was 
            thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <span id="farmers">[</span><q class="farmers">Oh dear, that’s too 
            bad,</q><span id="farmers">]</span> and the farmer responded, <span id="father">[</span><em>"Maybe."</em>
            <span id="father">]</span><br>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they 
            rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <span id="farmers">[</span><q class="farmers">Isn’t that great!</q><span id="farmers">]</span> Again, he said, 
            <span id="father">[</span><em>"Maybe."</em><span id="father">]</span>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
            whether anything that happens in it is good or bad - because you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.
